How to run:

simply cd into this directory and call: "$ ./ImgProcess.py"
this should tell you what commands and arguments you have 
available to you at each step of the assignment along with
the proper instruction format! 

Note: I've also included the source file inside 
the Assets/Images/Inputs folder as an example of where the 
input images are contained, otherwise place the desired image 
in there and then call the script using that image's name, 
as required.
